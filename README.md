## What the game is about?

FUSIUC is a cli game in python were u are basically playing hide and seek
with files with uncommon name and you have to shoot them , the target file will be hidden 
inside the directory 'dicts' and it's sub-directories 

sounds prety easy right? , so yeah let me tell you that there is a bad boi roaming around you and they will kill you for 
apperently no reason and did i told you that there is a time limit also and u can change it as per your conviniance and 
one more thing to remember is since u can edit so many things and it's open source also so u can just create your own games like guessing
the next move of the enemy

so feel free to roam the world of directories and sub-directories
